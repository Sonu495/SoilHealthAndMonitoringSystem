# Business Analyst: Shubesh Kumar Napit

## Project: Soil Health Monitoring System (SHMS)

## Role Overview
As the **Business Analyst (BA)** for the Soil Health Monitoring System, I bridge the gap between stakeholders and the technical team by translating business needs into functional and technical requirements. I ensure that the system aligns with agricultural industry goals, provides value to end-users (farmers, agronomists, researchers), and remains scalable, reliable, and user-centric.
